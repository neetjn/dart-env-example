# dart-env-example
Simple example of how to read environmental variables using Dart. Constants are loaded into `constants.dart`, to run the example use `dart run lib/dart_env_example.dart`.

There are a few patterns for accessing environment variables, however the null safety can be a bit to get used to. This interface is reflective of Python's approach.
